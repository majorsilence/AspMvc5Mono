This is an example project to start developing asp mvc 5 sites using mono 6.12 and ubuntu 20.04 or newer.

I highly recommend using the latest version of mono and monodevelop from http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-lin.

Required steps to use this example.

* Open Site.sln in [rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) of if on windows visual studio


To configure nginx to serve this project see https://github.com/majorsilence/NginxAspMvcHosting.

To host in docker run  __build_docker.sh__ whatever.
